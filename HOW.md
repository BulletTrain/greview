# How was this chart made?

Most of the charts follow the same routine. Let's use our [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://anvaka.github.io/greview/hands-on-ml/1/)
chart as a reference.

[![hands-on-chart](https://i.imgur.com/a3Gjzgp.png)](https://anvaka.github.io/greview/hands-on-ml/1/)

Starting from the ["Hands-On ML"](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1491962291), I collected from Amazon 10 books that are most often bought together (I used Amazonâ€™s product advertising api to fetch the graph).

Then, for each found book, I collected 5 more books that are most often bought together with them. Finally, I did this one more time for each found book.

After that, I ran my own algorithm to make a city from these books. 

The algorithm tends to group similar books into districts. You can find advanced theoretical books like [Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0262035618) and [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0262035618) clustered together in the North West. "For Dummies" series clustered on the East. North regions are taken by financial machine learning, and South is occupied by Python/Data Science books.

The roads on the map have symbolic meaning. The thicker the road, the more books are connected through it.

# What is that city like algorithm?

It's not publicly available yet, as I haven't figured everything out yet. It involves lots of tweaking
and ad-hoc modification. I hope by making more of these visualization I'll improve the algorithm
and release it one day. At the moment it's not ready.
